# Introduction to the Unix Shell for Binoformatics

## Overview
This tutorial was created to teaching the fundamentals of the unix shell to student in the Neural Systems and Behavior Course so that they can conduct analyses of RNA-seq data.

## Motivation
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a powerful tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don’t have to type the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources including “high-performance computing (HPC)” supercomputers. These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the utility and power of the Unix Shell
- Learn to view, create, and manipulate files and directories
- Learn to automate tasks to build reproducible research practices
